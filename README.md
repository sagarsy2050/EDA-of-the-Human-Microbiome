# EDA-of-the-Human-Microbiome
Introduction
Human body is a complex and fascinating machine. According to a 2016 research, there are 30 trillion cells in a 70kg man and and along with these cells, we are inhabited with almost the same number of bacterial cells. Other than bacteria we are also colonised by fungi, protists and viruses. These microbes govern a range of functions in health, disease and our behaviour. So, how about taking a journey and analyse this amazing world of human microbiota through a lens of data science? In this kernel, we will explore a data set that is available on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The data has been collected from 300 individuals and various genetic analysis have been done to analyse the microbes that inhabit various regions of the human body.

Objective
Here, we will try to answer some interesting questions, such as - i) Human body site showing most microbial diversity ii) The most common genus (taxonomic rank that comes above species) of microorganism found in the human body iii) Most ubiquitous microbe in the human body
